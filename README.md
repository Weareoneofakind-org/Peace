# Peace
Searching for Peace in human relations:
God, the Creator of the Universe, put us down here in order for us to love one another. To accomplish this very important goal, we need to learn to appreciate mankind whoever they are, wherever they are and whatever they do for a living. When God created us, his intent was that we always live in peace with one another. We tend to lose track of this essential feature of life on Planet Earth.
